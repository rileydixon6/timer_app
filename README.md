# Overview

This is a basic timer app. Press time to see the current time and how much time has passed since the last time you pressed the button. Press average to see average 
time between the time button being pressed. The idea is to be able to time contractions or baby feeding or sleeping schedules.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

To create the app I used IntelliJ and then Android Studio. The code is written in kotlin and is a continuation of the kotlin_timer (created in another repository).
